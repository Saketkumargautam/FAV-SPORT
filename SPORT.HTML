    <h2>BASKETBALL</h2>
    <p>
      <H5>Scoring</H5> In a game of basketball there are three clear ways to score
      points.<BR>
         If a shot is successfully scored from outside of the three-point
      line, three points are awarded. <BR>If a shot is successfully scored from
      inside of the three-point line, two points are awarded.<BR> If a team is
      awarded a technical foul then they will receive between one and three free
      shots.<BR> Each shot scored will be awarded with one point.

    <p><H5>Rules</H5>

        A basketball team can have a maximum of five players on the court.<BR>
        Player substitutions can be made at any time and there is no restriction on the number of substitutions made.<BR>
        A ball can travel through dribbling or passing.<BR>
        A player is no longer able to dribble with the ball once the player puts two hands on the ball. This does not include catching. At this point, a player must either pass or shoot.<BR>
        If a team wins possession back in their own half, they have ten seconds to get it into their opponent's end or a foul will be called.<BR>
        An attacking team has 24 seconds from gaining possession of the ball to shoot at the basket.<BR>
        After the shot is taken, the clock is restarted for another 24 seconds.<BR>
        After a team scores a basket, the ball is returned back to the opposition to start again.<BR>
        All fouls that are committed throughout a game are to be accumulated and when a certain number is reached, the umpire will award a free throw.<BR>
        Depending on where a technical foul is committed, the umpire may award a number of free throws a player will receive.<BR>
        Violations can be awarded by the officials in basketball for player handling errors. These include travelling, double dribble, goal-tending and back court violation.<BR>
